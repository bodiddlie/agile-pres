				<h1>Goodyear Apps &amp; Agile</h1>
				<h3>An overview</h3>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Agile Manifesto</h2>
				<ul style="text-align:center;list-style:none;">
					<li>Invdividuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
					<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
					<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
					<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value items on the left more.
				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					Notes go here
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is our objective?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Serve the Citizens?</li>
					<li>Assist City Staff?</li>
					<li>Align with Strategic Action Plan?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					No. As developers, our goal is to produce QUALITY SOFTWARE.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>How do we focus on that objective?</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Customer engagement &amp; involvement</li>
					<li>Accountability</li>
					<li>Minimizing impact of defects</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>User Stories</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Working with the customer to determine not just requirements, but also design</li>
					<li>Deep dive into what the customer wants</li>
					<li>Catch issues/concerns early</li>
					<li>Get that crucial customer buy-in</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Example User Story</h5>
				<p>
					As an <span class="fragment fade-in">Engineering Customer</span> I need to be able to <span class="fragment fade-in">sign-in at the front desk</span>.
				</p>
				<h6 class="fragment">Success Criteria</h6>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Can enter name and reason for visit</li>
					<li class="fragment">Both fields are required</li>
					<li class="fragment">Dropdown for common reason choices</li>
					<li class="fragment">After submission, staff are notified of customer in queue</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Estimation</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Estimation is difficult</li>
					<li>Current process is a best-guess effort</li>
					<li>Not tracking our estimates</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Better Estimates</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Break User Stories into achievable tasks</li>
					<li>Estimate effort, not time</li>
					<li>Assign points using Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)</li>
					<li>Group tasks into a sprints</li>
					<li># of points finished in sprint = <em>velocity</em></li>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Estimate example</h5>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Sprints</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Specific time interval. Same every time</li>
					<li>Every sprint results in a deliverable piece of software</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Nail, short, over</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Meet deadline exactly? Awesome onto the next.</li>
					<li>Come in under the deadline? Good, recalculate velocity, onto the next.</li>
					<li>Cut features or push deadline? Fine. Evaluate why, onto the next.</li>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>The key</h5>
				<p>They key is to constantly be reevaluating the tasks to see where they fit in the project. Tracking this gives us meaningful
					data on what we're doing and how we can change to make it better.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Customer Interaction</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Customer should be involved throughout project</li>
					<li>Building requirements through user stories is a customer centric activity</li>
					<li>Requirements are expected to change</li>
					<li>Continuous Improvement</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Defects</h5>
				<p>
					Bugs found as a result of working on a sprint are not bugs. They are part and parcel of development. They are to be fixed
					immediately and then they are done. Time spent tracking these is time lost focusing on the sprint.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a sprint is finished and a deliverable is out, any bugs found or reported
					<em>must</em> be tracked. These will often become new tasks or stories that need to be evaluated for priority.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Tracking Defects</h5>
				<p>
					Tracking defects that are found out-of-sprint is very important. They need to be carefully analyzed to determine why they
					made it out of sprint. This is not negative tracking. It just means we can potentially learn from it and prevent it
					during sprints in the future.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Tools</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>VSTS already has agile tooling.</li>
					<li>Stakeholder login</li>
					<li>Git</li>
					<li>Continuous Integration</li>
					<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
					<li>Code review</li>
				</ul>
